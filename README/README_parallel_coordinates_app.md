# **Parallel Coordinates - Custom Visualization**

Custom Visualizations give you new interactive ways to visualize your data during search and investigation, and to better communicate results in dashboards and reports. After installing this app youâ€™ll find a parallel coordinates visualization as an additional item in the visualization picker in Search and Dashboard.

Use parallel coordinates to show multidimensional patterns in a data set. Dimensions appear on vertical axes. Lines representing events connect the different axes.

Learn how to visualize data with parallel coordinates.

## **What parallel coordinates visualize**
Use parallel coordinates to show multidimensional patterns in a data set. Dimensions appear on vertical axes. Lines representing events connect the different axes.

### **Use case examples** 
You can use a parallel coordinates visualization to help you detect patterns in data sets with multiple variables.

- Retail activity
- Credit card transactions
- Product manufacturing processes and components

### **Data for parallel coordinates**
Use data that that includes numerical fields or a limited number of dimension fields. Search results should include fewer than 15 dimensions to render the visualization.



## **Create a parallel coordinates query**
Learn how to write a query to generate a parallel coordinates visualization.

### **Query syntax**
To generate a parallel coordinates visualization, use this query syntax.
```
... | <stats_function> by <dimension_field1>[, <dimension_field2>,  ... <dimension_fieldN>]  [ | fields -count ]
```

### **Query components**

#### **<stats_function>**
- **Required**
- Use this command to aggregate values in the field whose patterns you are tracking.

#### **<dimension_field1>**
- **Required**
- Values in this field appear on the visualization Y-axis. Indicate the field whose values you want to track through one or more dimensions in the visualization. For example, use a Food_group field to trace different nutrient counts for each group.

#### **Additional <dimension_field> list**
- Optional
- List additional fields whose values you want to include in the pattern you are tracking. Each field represents an additional dimension for the visualization.
- Search results must include at most 15 dimension fields to render the visualization.

#### **fields -count**
- Optional
- Use this command to remove the count field from the search results. This might be useful if you are tracking patterns instead of metric counts.

### **Search result data formatting** 
The parallel coordinates query syntax returns results in a table with multiple columns. Columns represent each dimension in the query and an optional count or other aggregation field.

Check the Statistics tab after running a query to make sure that the results table includes the correct columns in the required order.

| First | Second | Third |
|---|---|---|
| Y-axis field. Lines in the visualization originate with values in this field. | (Optional) One or more additional dimensions to include in the pattern | (Optional) Count or other aggregate values |

### **Example query**
Here is a parallel coordinates query tracking fat and calorie information for different food groups.
```
| inputlookup nutrients.csv | head 2500   | stats count by group, "fat (g)", "calories"
```

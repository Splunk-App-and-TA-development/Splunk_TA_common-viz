# ***Splunk Timeline - Custom Visualization - ver 1.5.0***

- Splunk Versions: 8.1, 8.0, 7.3

Custom Visualizations give you new interactive ways to visualize your data during search and investigation, and to better communicate results in dashboards and reports. After installing this app youâ€™ll find a timeline visualization as an additional item in the visualization picker in Search and Dashboard.

A timeline visualization shows activity time intervals and discrete events for a resource set. Activity for each resource appears in a separate timeline lane. If an activity start time and duration are available for a particular resource, the timeline shows a duration interval as a horizontal bar in the lane. If only the start time is available, the timeline shows a circle at that time.

This app gives you a new way to visualize your data, allowing you to better communicate information in dashboards and reports. After installing this app you will see Event Timeline Viz as an additional item in the visualization picker in Search and Dashboard.

The Event Timeline Viz shows multiple events on an interactive timeline. You can use the Event Timeline Viz to show the relationship between several time-based events in a dashboard panel or report.

## **Who is this app for?** 
This app is for anyone who wants to visualise and correlate multiple separate events on a common timeline.

## **How does the app work?**
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.

To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.

## **Usecases for the Event Timeline Visualization**
- Displaying time-based events
- Comparing the duration and severity of incident tickets created over the past month
- Tracking production releases and version information over time
- Visualizing server metrics over hours or days
- Tracking Notable Events over time

## **How to use the visualization**
The following fields can be used in the search:
- label (required): A title for the event being displayed.
- start (required): A date and time indicating the start of the event
- end (optional): A data and time indicating the end of the event
- group (optional): A group name to categorise the events and display them together
- color (optional): This is usually generated by the rangemap command. It is used to set the color for the slide. Valid colors are: red, amber, green. If using rangemap, use 'range' instead of 'color'. Valid values include: low, elevated, severe, ok, warning, etc
- data (optional): A value to use for drilldowns, which is not displayed to the user, e.g. ID numbers, references, sources. The data field will be used to populate the $tok_et_data$ token.


## **Example Search**
```
| makeresults count=25 
| eval start=_time-random()% 7*24*60*60 
| streamstats count as id
| eval label=case(id%3=0,"Event A", id%5=0,"Event B", id%7=0,"Event C", id%11=0,"Event D",1=1,"Event E")
| eval range=if(random()%2=0,"low","severe")
| table start, label, range
```


### **Tokens**
This visualization generates the following tokens on click:
- Start field - defaults to: `$tok_et_start$`
- End field - defaults to: `$tok_et_end$`
- Data field - defaults to: `$tok_et_data$`
- Label field - defaults to: `$tok_et_label$`
- All Visible Events' Data field - defaults to: `$tok_et_all_visible$`

Note: all token names are customisable in the visualization settings menu.

- Total results: 10,000

## **Release Notes**
Version 1.5.0<br>
March 28, 2020

#### v 1.5.0
Colors can now be set with HTML color codes. This will allow you to highlight events from the search by setting the color field to a HTML color code, e.g "#009933" or "#093". Note that if you supply both range and color fields, range takes precedence.
example:
```
...| eval color = case(status="critical","#ff0000", status="ok","#00FF00", status="unknown","#0000FF", 1=1,"#efefef")
| table label, start, end, group, color, tooltip, data
```

# **Splunk Visualization - Scatterplot Matrix**

The scatterplot matrix visualization allows comparison between numeric sets of data, giving a rough idea if there is a linear correlation between multiple fields.
The scatterplot matrix consists of Rows and Columns of individual Scatterplots that plot an X and a Y value.
These values come from the fields sent from the search bar.


## **How To Use and Read the Scatterplot Matrix**

The scatterplot matrix could be considered a table of sorts. Each row compares data against the column.<br>
So for each label (or field) that is displayed, follow the label to the scatterplot, and that is what is being compared.<br>
For example, the top right box of the example on this dashboard compares avg_kbps (Y axis) to stdevp_kbps (X axis).<br>
The bottom left box compares avg_kbps (X axis) to stdevp_kbps (Y axis).<br>
The axis are switched, and give a different visualization of the data.

Additionally, the graph supports some interactivity. 

Click and drag over a portion of a scatterplot, and the same XY coordinates in the other plots will also be highlighted, and the legend will reflect the items within that highlight.<br>
Mouseover the legend items, and the corresponding data points will be highlighted in the scatter plots.<br>

## **Configuration Options**
Scatterplot Matrix has many different configuration options, each split into similar sections. The options are displayed like this:

1. Configuration Option Name
    1. Valid Setting Options
    2. Description
    
## **Graph**

1. Box Padding
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This controls the space around each scatterplot.
	
2. Box Size
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This controls the size of each scatterplot.          
	
3. Number of Ticks
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This controls the number of tick marks on each axis.      
	
4. Axis Label Offset
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This controls how far away from the scatterplot matrix the labels for the axis appear.     
	
5. Height
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This is the height of the SVG. If you have clipping due to size, increase this.
	
6. Width
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This is the width of the SVG. If you have clipping due to size, increase this.

## **Legend**

1. **Show Legend**
    1. Yes, No
    2. This toggles the Legend.
                                
                            
2. **Height (px)**
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This is the height of the Legend Text.
                                
                            
3. **Position**
    1. Left, Right
    2. This controls where the legend is placed, either to the left or right of the
                                        matrix.
                                    
4. **Top Offset**
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This controls how far from the top of the Visualization the legend will
                                        display.
                                    
4. **Left Offset**
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. THis controls how far from the left of the Visualization the legend wilL
                                        display.
                                        
## **Trendline**

1. **Show Trendlines**
    1. Yes, No
    2. This toggles the trendlines for each scatterplot.
                                
                            
2. **Show R-Value**
    1. No, R, RÂ²
    2. Controls if, and how, the R value is displayed on the graph.
                                
                            
3. **Show One-to-One Data**
    1. Yes, No
    2. This controls the scatterplots on the Top-left to Bottom-Right Diagonal. This
                                        will remove the data points for those plots if No.
                          
4. **Trendline Width**
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    1. This sets the width of the Trendline.
                                
                            
5. **Trendline Color**

## **Debug**

1. **Javascript Logging**
    1. Yes, No
    2. Disables or enables the logging of debug information for the visualization.

## **Data Points**

1. **Dot Size**
    1. &lt;integer&gt;
    2. This controls the size of the data points in the scatterplots.

## **Example Search**

1. `index=_internal component=Metrics group=per_sourcetype_thruput | bin _time span=1h | stats avg(kbps) as avg_kbps avg(eps) as avg_eps avg(ev) as avg_ev by series _time | fields - _time_`
2. `index=_internal component=Metrics group=per_sourcetype_thruput | stats avg(kbps) as avg_kbps avg(kb) as kb avg(eps) as avg_eps avg(ev) as avg_ev by series`
3. `|makeresults | eval data = "0,8;0,7;1,7;1,5;3,4;4,2,4,5;3,6;1,8;2,9", recs = split(data,";") | mvexpand recs | eval t = split(recs, ","), X = mvindex(t,0), Y = mvindex(t,1), series = "person" | fields series X Y | fields - _*`

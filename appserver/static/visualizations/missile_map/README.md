# Missile Map

This visualiation will show connected arcs on a map. Each arc is defined by two geographic points, and can have a color assigned. Additionally the arcs can be animated, with the pulsing animation being either at the start or the end of the arc.

Globally, the arc thickness, default color and map tileset can be chosen, as well as the starting map position and zoom.

This visualisation is based upon leaflet.migrationLayer by react-map: https://github.com/react-map/leaflet.migrationLayer

Some use cases could be:

 * Show data replication links between sites and their status
 * Show a representation of incoming attacks or requests

 Note: If any lines are animated this will result in heightened browser CPU usage.

# Search and data formatting

The visualisation looks for fields of the following names:

  * start_lat: The starting point latitude (required)
  * start_lon: The starting point longitude (required)
  * end_lat: The ending point latitude (required)
  * end_lon: The ending point latitude (required)
  * color: The color of the arc in hex format (optional, default "#FF0000")
  * animate: Whether to animate this arc (optional, default "false")
  * pulse_at_start: When animated, set to true to cause the pulse to be at the start of the arc instead of the end (optional, default "false")
  * weight: The line weight of the arc (optional, default 1).

 The fields must be named in this way, but they are not order dependent.

 An example dataset is distributed as a lookup to experiment with.

 ```
 | inputlookup missilemap_testdata
 ```

 # Customisation options

The following options are available to customise:

 * Lines
 	* Default color: The color to use for a line when no "color" field is present in the data (default: #65a637)
 	* Weight: The weight to use for a line when no "weight" field is present in the data (default: 1)
 * Map
 	* Tile set: The map tiles to use
 	* Custom tile set: If you wish to use a tile set not in the preset list (e.g. http://tile.stamen.com/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png)
 	* Latitude: Starting latitude to load
 	* Longitude: Starting longitude to load
 	* Zoom: Starting zoom level to load

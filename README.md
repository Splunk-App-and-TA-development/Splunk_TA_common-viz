## **Animated Chart Viz** 
- Versionsion 1.0.0
- Autor: Daniel Spavin
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5465/

### How to use Animated Chart Viz
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.

To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search using timechart to provide the values to display.

Usecases for the Animated Chart Visualization:
- Displaying server status based on CPU, Memory, I/O, or Disk usage over time
- Showing customer satisfaction ratings over time
- Viewing a single metric by host over time


#### **Supported Fields**
Animated Charts Viz is designed to use the output from | timechart. Use the following fields in the search:

- `_time` (required) The time period for the event. If no time value is supplied, the first field is used for the slices.
- `<category 1>` (required) The name for the value, e.g host, and the actual value.
- `<category 2>` (optional) The name for the value, e.g host, and the actual value.
- `<category 3>` (optional) The name for the value, e.g host, and the actual value.

#### **Example Search**
```
index=_internal earliest=-24h@h latest=now
| timechart span=15m count by sourcetype
```

#### **Tokens**
Tokens are generated each time you click an item. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.

| ***Name*** | This is the name of the selected item. | Default value: `$ac_name_token$` |
| ***Value*** | This is the value of the selected item you clicked. | Default value: `$ac_value_token$` |
| ***Time Slice*** | This is the current time slice of the visualisation. | Default value: `$ac_time_token$` |

### How to use Arc Globe Visualisation
This app is for dashboard designers who want to compare relative sizes of metrics in an infographic style pictorial chart.

#### How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.

To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.

#### Usecases for the Pictorial Chart Visualization:
- Displaying server status based on CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage
- Showing user or customer ratings in a scale
- Comparing the ratio of good vs bad results or outcomes

- `icon` (optional): This selects the icon to use in the pictorial chart.
- `color` (optional): Used to set the color of the icon in the chart.
Options can be overwritten, so if type or color is set multiple times in the search results, the last value will be used.


#### Example Search
```
| makeresults count=5
| streamstats count as id
| eval icon=case(id==1, "frown", id==2, "flushed", id==3, "grin", id==4, "grin-stars",id==5, "grin-hearts")
| eval label=case(id==1, "Unhappy", id==2, "Unsure", id==3, "Happy", id==4, "Amazing",id==5, "Love It")
| eval value = id + random()%5
| sort id
| table label, value, icon
```

#### Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click an item. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.

- **Label text**: This is the name of the selected group. Default value: `$pc_label_token$`
- **Value**: This is the value of the selected group you clicked. Default value: `$pc_value_token$`

## **Carousel Viz** 
- Version 1.1.3
- Author: Daniel Spavin
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4342/
  
### How to use Carousel Viz
This app is for anyone who wants to display several metrics on a small area of a dashboard.
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.

#### Usecases for the Departures Board Visualization
- Displaying current server metrics like CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage
- Scrolling through a list of sales by category or date
- Showing related application metrics in a discreet dashboard panel
- Rotating through all open Priority 1 ticket numbers


#### The following fields can be used in the search
- **value** (required): If you don't define a field called value, the first field will be used to display the value text.
- **unit** (optional): You can define a unit for the value, e.g. '$' or '%'. A value in the unit field will override the default unit configured in settings.
- **caption** (optional): A caption to display for this value. If you define a caption field, it will override the default caption configured in settings.
- **range** (optional): This is usually generated by the rangemap command. It is used to set the color for the slide.

#### Example Search
```
| makeresults count=5 
| streamstats count as id
| eval value=case(id==1,42.4, id==2,74, id==3,"2", id==4,"55",id==5,"622") 
| eval unit=case(id==1,"%", id==2,"MB", id==3,"%", id==4,"Mbps",id==5,"Users") 
| eval caption=case(id==1,"CPU Use", id==2,"Free Memory", id==3,"Free Disk Space", id==4,"Network Use",id==5,"Active Users") 
| eval range=case(id==1,"low", id==2,"elevated", id==3,"severe", id==4,"low",id==5,"low") 
| table value, unit, caption, range
```

#### Tokens
Tokens are generated eacht time you click a slide. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.
- `Formatted Value`: This is the 'value' field, that has undergone any formatting changes from the options, e.g. all-caps for text or decimal places and commas for numbers. Use this token to display to the user. Default value: `$cv_formatted_value$`
- `Raw Value`: This is the value as it was defined in the search results. Use this token in searches for exact matches of the raw data. Default value: `$cv_raw_value$`
- `Caption`: This is the 'caption' field. If you use the hostname of a server as the caption, you can create additional searches by using this value. Default value: `$cv_caption$`
- `Unit`: This is the 'unit' field, or the default value for unit. Use this token to help users make sense of the Formatted Value token. Default value: `$cv_unit$`

![example-Carousel](https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/75796e9a-0f2c-11e9-a61d-02195aa3b284.png)

  
  
## **Circlepack Viz** 
- Version 1.1.4
- Author: Chris Younger
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4574/

### How to use Circlepack Viz
Circle packing / Pack layout / bubble chart visualization built with D3.  Optional click-to-zoom and plenty of color themes.

#### Search Examples
The typical search uses stats command like so:

`index=* | stats count BY index sourcetype source`

Sidenote: a much faster search to do the same thing is

`|tstats count where index=* BY index sourcetype source`

Note that stats does not return rows when the group BY field is null. Convert nulls to be an empty string like this:
```
index=_internal 
| eval component = coalesce(component,"") 
| eval log_level = coalesce(log_level,"") 
| stats count BY sourcetype component log_level
```

Add more fields after the "BY" keyword to increase the depth

## **Cluster Map Viz** 
- Version 1.2
- Author: Siegfried Puchbauer
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3122/

### How to use Cluster Map Viz
This app adds a custom cluster-map visualization to your Splunk instance. It shows styled radiation icons in different colors for each cluster of geographical results, including the numerical value as a label.

The custom cluster map visualization displays numeric values on a map. Both cluster icon size and color are determined by the numeric value automatically.

#### Example Usage
The visualization expects search results produced by the geostats search command. Results are postprocessed automatically using the geofilter command in order to retrieve results for the visible map area and zoom level.

Note: it does support a split-by clause, only a single numeric value by location can be processed.
```
sourcetype=access_combined | iplocation clientip | geostats count
sourcetype=gps_locations | fields lat lng signal_strength | geostats avg(signal_strength) latfield=lat longfield=lng maxzoomlevel=18
```

- Version 1.1.0
- Author: Aplura LLC
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3149/

### How to use Scatterplot Matrix
The scatterplot matrix visualization allows comparison between numeric sets of data, giving a rough idea if there is a linear correlation between multiple fields.
The scatterplot matrix consists of Rows and Columns of individual Scatterplots that plot an X and a Y value.
These values come from the fields sent from the search bar.

#### **Example Search**

1. `index=_internal component=Metrics group=per_sourcetype_thruput | bin _time span=1h | stats avg(kbps) as avg_kbps avg(eps) as avg_eps avg(ev) as avg_ev by series _time | fields - _time_`
2. `index=_internal component=Metrics group=per_sourcetype_thruput | stats avg(kbps) as avg_kbps avg(kb) as kb avg(eps) as avg_eps avg(ev) as avg_ev by series`
3. `|makeresults | eval data = "0,8;0,7;1,7;1,5;3,4;4,2,4,5;3,6;1,8;2,9", recs = split(data,";") | mvexpand recs | eval t = split(recs, ","), X = mvindex(t,0), Y = mvindex(t,1), series = "person" | fields series X Y | fields - _*`

![example-Scatterplot-Matrix](https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/dfe6cbda-1324-11e6-845c-06caea5ac9f9.png)



## **Dendrogram Viz** 
- Version 1.0.3
- Author: Chris Younger
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5153/

### How to use Dendrogram
This visualisation expects a table of data with specific field names.
There are two main data formats, one with a column called "path" or a second format with fields "child" and "parent".
Additional optional columns are listed below.

- `path` - this column/field should be forward-slash delimited, but you can change the delimiter in the formatting options.
- `parent` - this column/field is a unique name for this node's parent. it is optional.
- `child` - this column/field is a unique name for the node.
- `color` - a HTML color code or hex value to use for coloring the node
- `drilldown` - when a user clicks a node, the contents of this drilldown field will be set in a token called $dendrogram_viz_drilldown$. See token section below.
- `tooltip` - content to show on the tooltip when a user hovers the node
- `names` - can be used to change node names. Should be the same 'depth' as the path.

#### **Example Search**
Here is an example search that you can use with web data

`index=web | stats count by uri_path | rename uri_path as path`

Here is an example of how the "path" data format should look

| table text, id
```
A sample data set is included with the app:

`| inputlookup departures-board-cities-lookup.csv`

#### Tokens
Two tokens are generated by the visualization - one for the text which is displayed, and one for an associated id field. By default the tokens are called:
- `dbv_term`: The currently displayed value
- `dbv_id`: An ID field to assist further searches

Token names are customizable.

## **Flow Map Viz** 
- Version 1.4.1.1
- Author: Chris Younger
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4657/

### How to use Flow Map
A visualization used to show the volume of traffic across links.
By default, this addon will normalise the traffic flows so the proportion of traffic can be shown, however this can be disabled.
Optionally show marching ants lines to indicate direction. Optionally allows embedded HTML which enables endless customisation. AKA force-directed or network graph.

This visualisation expects tabular data, with specific field names. There are two kinds of row data that should be supplied: links and nodes.
The link data is identified by having both a from and to field, or a path field. The path field is delimited by three hyphens "---" and can include hops through multiple nodes.
The node data will have a node field.

#### Example 1, simple links using `from / to` fields
| from | to | good
|---|---|---|
| users | loadbalancer | 3000 |
| loadbalancer | webserver1 | 1000 |
| loadbalancer | webserver2 | 1500 |
| loadbalancer | webserver3 | 500 |

Note that nodes are automatically created.

![example-1](https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/docimages/b896838e-c72d-11e9-90ac-06a3434e669e.png)


#### Example 2, same output using path field
| path | good |
|---|---|
| users---loadbalancer---webserver1 | 1000 |
| users---loadbalancer---webserver2 | 1500 |
| users---loadbalancer---webserver3 | 500 |

Shared links will have the fields "good", "warn" and "error" automatically summed together



#### Example 3, customise output by adding "node" rows
For the users and loadbalancer rows, a custom label is set, along with a font-awesome icon and the label is moved underneath.

| path | good | node | label | icon | height | labely |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| users---loadbalancer---webserver1 | 1000 |  |  |  |  |  |
| users---loadbalancer---webserver2 | 1500 |  |  |  |  |  |
| users---loadbalancer---webserver3 | 500 |  |  |  |  |  |
| users---loadbalancer---webserver3 | 500 |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | users | Users | user | 40 | 30 |
|  |  | loadbalancer | LoadBalancer | hdd | 40 | 30 |

![example-3](https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/docimages/915328d6-c72d-11e9-b5db-06a551a85bba.png)

Its an unsual concept to have a single search that produces two different sets of data, however this can be easily performed using append.

For example you can define all nodes and links in a lookup table and append it after all your search data like so:
```
existing search | append [ |inputlookup my_table_of_nodes_and_links.csv ]
```

## **Force Directed App For Splunk** 
- Version 3.1.0
- Author: Splunk Inc.
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3767/

### How to use Force Directed App
This app was created to allow IT Operations administrators and the security team to visualize there networks, attack paths inside an environment, connections between objects.
The limits are endless. Some of the features that are supported in this app are:

- Customisation to Attract and Repel Forces
- Selectable Dark and White Theme
- Automatic Grouping and colouring of nodes
- Customisation to collision forces to avoid overlapping

### Search Examples
- `index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | table src_ip, dest_ip, count`
- `sourcetype=access_combined | stats count by src_ip,uri_path`

![example-force-directed](https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/0340ab02-b7b4-11e7-80fc-0283f2e1b808.png)




## **Heat Map Viz** 
- Version 1.3.1
- Author: Daniel Spavin
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4460/

### How to use Heat Map
The Heat Map Viz shows a grid of related measurements, with the color intensity relative to the metric value.

- Displaying server metrics like CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage over time
- Comparing sales volume by category over time
- Showing related application metrics in a discreet dashboard panel
- Highlighting any metrics relative to other entities

**The following fields can be used in the search:**
- `_time` (required): The easiest way to construct a search is to use the | timechart command, with a by clause.
- `category fields` (required): Each field name will become a label on the side, with the values being used to set the color based on thresholds. The order of the fields determines the order shown in the viz.

#### Example Search
```
| gentimes start=-7 increment=4h
| eval "Server Availability"=random()%100, "Customer Satisfaction"=random()%100,"Server Performance"=random()%100, _time=starttime
| table _time, "Server Availability","Customer Satisfaction","Server Performance"
```

#### Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click a cell. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carrying across.

- **Value:** This is the numeric field for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_value$
- **Label:** This is the field name for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_label$
- **Time:** This is the '_time' field for the selection. Default value: $hm_token_time$

## **Link Analysis App For Splunk** 
- Version 1.6.3
- Author: Mickey Perre
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4676/#/details

### How to use Link Analysis App
This app provides a seperate visualisation framework for doing force directed visualisation with additional functionality.

#### Basic Search Examples
- `index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | table src_ip, dest_ip, count`
- `sourcetype=access_combined | stats count by src_ip,uri_path`

#### Extended Search Examples (Optional Fields)
- **line_label** - To specify the line label of an edge
```index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port | rename dest_port as line_label```
***Will make the destination port the line label***
- **line_color** - To specify a color of an edge
```index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | eval line_color=if(count>10,"red","green"```
***If count is greater than 10 make the line red else make it green.***
- **remove** - For huge graphs, it is often faster to remove all nodes off of the graph and start with only one node on the graph.  All nodes that have any children can be expanded from here.
```index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | eval remove="192.168.1.1```
***Remove all nodes from the graph except 192.168.1.1, if 192.168.1.1 is clicked the children will be re-added to the graph***
- **preFilter** - Allows you to prefilter your graph and remove all nodes that are connected to the node specified in the field.
***Delete all nodes from the graph that are not children of 192.168.1.1***

## **Missile Map** 
- Version 1.2.3
- Author: Luke Monahan
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3511/

### How to use Missile Map
This visualisation will show connected arcs on a map. Each arc is defined by two geographic points, and can have a color assigned.
Additionally the arcs can be animated, with the pulsing animation being either at the start or the end of the arc.

#### **Search and data formatting**

The visualisation looks for fields of the following names:

- `start_lat`: The starting point latitude (required)
- `start_lon`: The starting point longitude (required)
- `end_lat`: The ending point latitude (required)
- `end_lon`: The ending point latitude (required)
- `color`: The color of the arc in hex format (optional, default "#FF0000")
- `animate`: Whether to animate this arc (optional, default "false")
- `pulse_at_start`: When animated, set to true to cause the pulse to be at the start of the arc instead of the end (optional, default "false")
- `weight`: The line weight of the arc (optional, default 1).

 The fields must be named in this way, but they are not order dependent.

 An example dataset is distributed as a lookup to experiment with.

 ```
 | inputlookup missilemap_testdata
 ```

#### **Customisation options**

The following options are available to customise:

- Lines
	* Default color: The color to use for a line when no "color" field is present in the data (default: #65a637)
 	* Weight: The weight to use for a line when no "weight" field is present in the data (default: 1)
- Map
 	* Tile set: The map tiles to use
 	* Custom tile set: If you wish to use a tile set not in the preset list (e.g. http://tile.stamen.com/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png)
 	* Latitude: Starting latitude to load
 	* Longitude: Starting longitude to load
 	* Zoom: Starting zoom level to load

## **Network Diagram Viz** 
- Version 2.0.0
- Author: Daniel Spavin
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4438/

### How to use Network Diagram
This app gives you a new way to visualize your data, allowing you to better communicate information in dashboards and reports. After installing this app you will see Network Diagram Viz as an additional item in the visualization picker in Search and Dashboard.

The Network Diagram Viz lets you visualize how different monitored end-points relate to one another. You can use the Network Diagram Viz to show the relationship between servers, services, or people in a dashboard panel or report.

As seen in the Splunk blog post: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/visual-link-analysis-with-splunk-part-2-the-visual-part.html


#### **Usecases for the Network Diagram Visualization**
- Displaying current server status based on CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage
- Visually associating users with actions, e.g. purchases, crashes, errors
- Visualising the connection speeds between two hosts or services
- Showing how events are related to eachother

#### The following fields can be used in the search
- `from` (required): The unique name of the source entity.
- `to` (optional): The unique name of the destination entity.
- `value` (optional): Text to display as a tool tip. This text is also available as a token when the entity (from) is clicked.
- `type` (optional): This is used to display the entity on the dashboard (from). Use the list of icons available, Splunk server icons, or shapes.
- `color` (optional): Used to set the color of the text and icon (except for Splunk icons).
- `linktext` (optional): Text to display on the link between the from and to entities.

Options can be overwritten, so if type or color is set multiple times in the search results, the last value will be used. This is useful if you wish to set the icon types and values via a lookup table at the end of your search.

#### **Example Search**
```
| makeresults count=12
| streamstats count as id 
| eval from=case(id=1,"Load Balancer",id=2,"Load Balancer",id=3,"Load Balancer", id=4,"Web 1",id=5,"Web 1", id=6, "Web 2",id=7,"Web 2", id=8,"Web 3",id=9,"Web 3",id=10,"App Server 1",id=11,"App Server 2",id=12, "Database Server") 
| eval to=case(id=1,"Web 1",id=2,"Web 2",id=3,"Web 3", id=4,"App Server 1",id=5,"App Server 2", id=6, "App Server 1",id=7,"App Server 2", id=8,"App Server 1",id=9,"App Server 2",id=10,"Database Server",id=11,"Database Server",id=12, "") 
| eval value=case(id=1,"Load Balancer",id=2,"Load Balancer",id=3,"Load Balancer", id=4,"Web 1",id=5,"Web 1", id=6, "Web 2",id=7,"Web 2", id=8,"Web 3",id=9,"Web 3",id=10,"App Server 1",id=11,"App Server 2",id=12, "Database Server") 
| eval type=case(id=1,"sitemap",id=4,"server", id=6, "server",id=8,"server",id=10,"server",id=11,"server",id=12, "database") 
| fields from, to, value, type
```

#### **Tokens**
Tokens are generated each time you click a node. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.

- **Node:** This is the unique node name (e.g. the server name). Default value: `$nd_node_token$`
- **Value:** This is the value/tooltip as it was defined in the search results. Default value: `$nd_value_token$`


To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.

## **Number Display Viz** 
- Version 1.6.8
- Author: Chris Younger
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4537/

### How to use Number Display
A collection of ultra-configurable, single-statistic visualizations for Splunk. Includes the following styles: gauge, horseshoe, spinner, shapes (rectangle, hexagon, circle, ring, donut). Make dashboards come alive with animated number changes and subtle pulse animations.

This visualization can deal with most datasets you want to throw at it. However for the most reliable results, use a search where the field names are exactly "value", "title" and "sparkline".
```
|stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value
```

For multiple items do this:
```
| rename SPLIT_CATEGORY as title | stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value BY title
```

The configured viz formatting can be overridden in data by havign specifically named fields.<br>
Here is an example where the subtitle is supplied in the data:
```
| rename SPLIT_CATEGORY as title | stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value latest(SOME_VALUE2) as subtext BY title
```

another way of doing the same thing is like so:
```
| rename SPLIT_CATEGORY as title | stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value BY title | eval subtext = "something"
```

These are the fields that can be overridden in data:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| value | Numeric | The value which will be used for threshold calculation and to set the gauge position or spinner speed. Viz will attempt to autoguess this field if not explicity supplied. |
| title | String | The title of the metric which will be shown as a text overlay. Viz will attempt to autoguess this field if not explicity supplied. |
| sparkline | sparkline array | The sparkline field to use as the area or line chart overlay. Viz will attempt to autoguess this field if not explicity supplied. |
| color | HTML color code | Set the base color, ignoring the thresholds. By using this field you can use any threshold logic you like in the search query |
| primarycolor | HTML color code | Similar to above but will only override the primary color. The threshold color can still be used by other components. The primary color is only used by the main element (the gauge, spinner or shape background) in the viz. |
| secondarycolor | HTML color code | As above. |
| text | String | If supplied, this field enables overriding what would be shown as the numeric value |
| subtitle | String | Override the subtitle value. Note that subtitle must be blank in the formatting options |
| min | Number | Overrides the "min" limit |
| max | Number | Overrides the "max" limit |

## **Parallel Coordinates Viz** 
- Version 1.5.0
- Author: Splunk Inc.
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3137/

### How to use Parallel Coordinates
Use parallel coordinates to show multidimensional patterns in a data set. Dimensions appear on vertical axes. Lines representing events connect the different axes.

#### Use case examples
You can use a parallel coordinates visualization to help you detect patterns in data sets with multiple variables.

- Retail activity
- Credit card transactions
- Product manufacturing processes and components

#### Data for parallel coordinates
Use data that that includes numerical fields or a limited number of dimension fields. Search results should include fewer than 15 dimensions to render the visualization.

#### Query syntax
To generate a parallel coordinates visualization, use this query syntax.
```
... | <stats_function> by <dimension_field1>[, <dimension_field2>,  ... <dimension_fieldN>]  [ | fields -count ]
```
#### Example query
Here is a parallel coordinates query tracking fat and calorie information for different food groups.
```
| inputlookup nutrients.csv | head 2500   | stats count by group, "fat (g)", "calories"
```

## **Performance Analysis** 
- Version 1.3.0
- Author: Daniel Spavin
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4258/

### How to use Performance Analysis
The Performance Analysis Visualization allows you to compare two related metrics over time in a tabular format. Use cases include comparing your infrastructure and application health, showing performance and availability of synthetic monitoring scripts, and tracking build status vs code commits over time. This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards. 

#### Usecases for the Performance Analysis Visualization
1. Displaying both infrastructure and application health over time
2. Showing both performance and availability of transactions from a selenium script (Application Performance Monitoring)
3. Monitoring Application health and exceptions over the past day or week
4. Tracking the number of code commits vs build status over time

#### The following fields can be used in the search
- `_time` (required): the time field for the events.
- `name` (required): The label for each row of the table. This usually represents the server name.
- `value` (required): The numeric value of the primary metric - e.g. CPU %. This will determine the colour of the cells.
- `status` (required): This represents the secondary metric - e.g. Application health. Status is used to create the icon or numeric value. Can be textual: GREEN / AMBER / RED, or numeric: 12.22. If you don't want to show a status, you can set this to "" (...| eval staus="" |...)
- `warning_threshold` (optional): This value determines when the cell background color changes from GREEN to AMBER. You can set a different warning_threshold for each name, or use the default settings.
- `critical_threshold` (optional): This value determines when the cell background color changes from AMBER to RED. You can set a different critical_threshold for each name, or use the default settings.

#### Example Search
```
index=_internal earliest = -24h@h group=*| rename group as name, date_second as value, date_minute as status | table _time, name, value, status
```

A sample data set is included with the app:
```
| inputlookup sample-data.csv
```

![Performance-Analysis-viz](https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/67382a46-d43b-11e8-88c0-06149817de84.png)




## **Punchcard - Custom Visualization** 
- Version 1.5.0
- Author: Splunk Inc.
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3129/

### How to use *Punchcard
Punchcards can visualize cyclical trends in your data. This visualization shows circles representing a metric aggregated over two dimensions, such as hours of the day and days of the week. Using a punchcard, you can see relative values for a metric where the dimensions intersect.

**Documentation:**
* http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Punchcard/1.2.0/PunchcardViz/PunchcardIntro

#### Use case examples
- Website or network activity
- Retail trend analysis
- Environmental or geological activity

#### Search syntax
Use this syntax to generate a punchcard.
```
... | <stats_function>[(metric_field)] [<stats_function>(color_field)] by <first_dimension> <second_dimension>
```

### Search example
Here is a search that analyzes bicycle rental popularity by hours and days.

`inputlookup bikeshare.csv | stats count by date_hour date_wday`

`index=_internal | head 100000 | stats count by date_hour sourcetype`

`index=_internal | head 100000 | stats count by date_minute sourcetype`

`index=_internal | head 100000 | stats count, avg(date_minute) by date_minute sourcetype`

![Punchcard-viz](https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/9a7b80ac-01e2-11e6-b676-06a7b631375d.png)





## **Region Chart Viz** 
- Version 1.0.5
- Author: Chris Younger
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4911/

### How to use Region Chart
This visualisation should work with any data that works with the Splunk built-in line chart. The first column (which is often "_time") will be the X-axis and subsequent columns will be rendered as lines (so they should be numeric values). A column with the specific name "regions" should be supplied which defines the regions to draw behind the chart.

**This is how the data should look:**

![how-to-look](https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/docimages/8628f93e-6383-11ea-a800-0628ba56719c.png)

Regions are drawn per-column vertically, from bottom to top. Horizontal regions can be drawn by setting the same region value on multiple columns. See the examples below.

The format for the region field is comma-seperated key-value pairs and best explained with examples:

| "regions" field | Result |
| red | The most basic example that creates a region. A red column of data will be drawn from the bottom of the chart to the top of chart. Region colors can be specificed as valid HTML colours (RBG, Hex, named colours, etc..). |
| Out of hours=#ccccc | Create a named region in a grey color for the chart column. This name will be seen on the tooltip when hovering the chart. |
| green,1000,orange,1500,red | Create a green region from the bottom of the chart to 1000, an orange region from 1000 to 1500 and a red region from 1500 to the top of the chart. |
| ,1000,Warning=orange,1500,Critical=red | Create a orange region from 1000 to 1500 and a red region from 1500 to the top of the chart. |

#### **Examples**
#### Charting ITSI Time-Based Policies
Especially useful for visualizing the adaptive thresholds that were set by ITSI (also works with ITSI static thresholds). Requires add-on Get ITSI Thresholds - custom command
```
index="itsi_summary" itsi_service_id=c2d8f443-fd65-4872-b3b8-1ac7757b57f6 kpiid=a672f70631ce28a0be31e1f2 indexed_is_service_max_severity_event=0 
| timechart span=1h avg(alert_value) as alert_value 
| getitsithresholds service=c2d8f443-fd65-4872-b3b8-1ac7757b57f6 kpi=a672f70631ce28a0be31e1f2
```

#### Show business hours
Over a 24 hour chart, show the hours that are important.
```
... search ...
| timechart span=1h avg(series1) as avg
| eval hour = strftime(_time, "%H")
| eval regions = if(hour > 17 OR hour < 9,"Out of hours=#009DD9","") 
| fields - hour
```

![show-business-hours](https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/docimages/03adf1dc-6386-11ea-8464-0a5ced90e458.png)


#### Show static thresholds
Hardcoded simple static thresholds.
```
... search ... 
| timechart span=1m avg(series1) as avg
| eval regions = "normal=#99D18B,5000,Warning=#FCB64E,7000,Error=#B50101"
```

![show-static-thresholds](https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/docimages/0f26fde2-6386-11ea-82f8-0a385577a33e.png)


#### Show that data might be incomplete
Add a gray region to highlight the area of the chart that is less than 15 minutes old. Can easily be adapted to show a maintinance window.
```
... search ... 
| timechart span=1h avg(series1) as avg
| eval regions = if(_time > (now() - 900),"Data still arriving=#aaaaaa","")
```

![show-incomplete-data](https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/docimages/11ba059a-6386-11ea-9c57-0a5ced90e458.png)


#### Show 2/3 standard deviations above/below the average, for same time last week
Calculate the historical average and standard deviation of the data. Then mark regions based on the standard deviations.
```
... search over 2 weeks of data ... 
| timechart span=1h avg(FIELD) as avg stdev(FIELD) as stddev 
| timewrap w series=short align=now 
| where _time > now() - 86400 
| eval regions = "3 standard deviations below=#B50101," + tostring(avg_s1 - stddev_s1 * 3) + ",2 standard deviations below=#FCB64E," + tostring(avg_s1 - stddev_s1 * 2) + ",normal=#99D18B," + tostring(avg_s1 + stddev_s1 * 2) + ",2 standard deviations above=#FCB64E," + tostring(avg_s1 + stddev_s1 * 3) + ",3 standard deviations above=#B50101" 
| table _time avg_s0 avg_s1 regions
```

### How to use Sankey Diagram
Sankey diagrams show metric flows and category relationships. You can use a Sankey diagram to visualize relationship density and trends.

A Sankey diagram shows category nodes on vertical axes. Fluid lines show links between source and target categories. Link width indicates relationship strength between a source and target.

## **Query syntax**
To generate a Sankey diagram, use this query syntax.
```
... | stats <stats_function>(<size_field>) [<stats_function>(<color_field>)] by <source_category_field> <target_category_field>
```

## **Semicircle Donut Chart Viz** 
- Version 1.2.3
- Author: Chris Younger
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4378/<br>
- https://github.com/ChrisYounger/semicircle_donut

### How to use Semicircle Donut Chart
A simple donut/pie chart that can be displayed as a semicircle and supports multiple series on a single chart.

#### Example search query with one dimention:  

`index=_internal |stats count by log_level `

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisYounger/semicircle_donut/master/static/example1.png)


#### Example search with two dimentions: 

`index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access| stats avg(spent) as spend avg(bytes) as bytes by method`
![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisYounger/semicircle_donut/master/static/example2.png)


#### Example of how to explicity set colours:

`index=_internal | eval len = len(_raw) |stats count by log_level | eval color = case(log_level=="ERROR", "#af575a", log_level=="WARN", "#ed995f", log_level=="INFO", "#4fa484", true(), "#cccccc")`
You then need to go into the "Format" options and type the field name "color".

## **Status Indicator Viz** 
- Version 1.4.0
- Author: Splunk Inc.
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3119/<br>
- http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StatusIndicator/1.3.0/StatusIndicatorViz/StatusIndicatorReleaseNotes

### How to use Status Indicator
Status indicators show a value and an icon. You can use a status indicator to provide information at a glance.

#### **Query syntax** 
To generate a status indicator, use the following query syntax.
```
...| table <count> <icon_field> <color_field>
```
Aggregate the value you are tracking and use the table command to order field values.

#### Example query
Here is a status indicator query that specifies a static icon and color.
```
index=_internal
| head 100
| stats count
| eval count=count+random()%1000
| eval icon="exclamation-circle"
| eval color="#F58F39"
| table count icon color
```

## **Sunburst Viz** 
- Version 1.3.2
- Author: Chris Younger
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4550/

### How to use Sunburst
This visualisation expects tabular data, with any amount of text/category columns, but the last column must be a numerical value.  Null or blank columns are allowed before the final column to create a more "sunburst-y" visualization.

The typical search uses `stats` command like so:
```
index=* | stats count BY index sourcetype source
```

Sidenote: a much faster search to do the same thing is 
```
|tstats count where index=* BY index sourcetype source
```

Note that `stats` does not return rows when the group BY field is `null`. Use this one simple trick to convert nulls to be an empty string instead:

```
index=_internal | eval component = coalesce(component,"") | eval log_level = coalesce(log_level,"") | stats count BY sourcetype component log_level
```

Add more fields after the "BY" keyword to increase the depth of the sunburst



#### **Formatting options**
![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisYounger/sunburst_viz/master/appserver/static/formatting.png)

The "Color overrides" field accepts either a JSON object (in curly braces) or comma separated pairs. For example to make sure that "INFO" values are green, WARN's are orange and ERROR's are red, set the value like so:
```
INFO,#1a9035,ERROR,#b22b32,WARN,#AF5300
```

## **Timeline Viz** 
- Version 1.5.0
- Author: Splunk Inc.
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3120/

### How to use Timeline
A timeline visualization shows activity time intervals and discrete events for a resource set. 
Activity for each resource appears in a separate timeline lane. 
- If an activity start time and duration are available for a particular resource, the timeline shows a duration interval as a horizontal bar in the lane.
- If only the start time is available, the timeline shows a circle at that time.

## **Treemap - Custom Visualization** 
- Version 1.4.0
- Author: Splunk Inc.
- https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3118/

### How to use Treemap
A treemap represents data patterns and hierarchy. Each treemap divides a single space into multiple rectangles to show data values and category relationships.

#### Use cases
Use a treemap to visualize how a general metric divides across different areas or categories.

- Budgets and expenses** 
- Data center server status
- University departments and courses offered

#### Data for treemaps
A treemap data set includes metric and category information for all events. Use events with fields representing the common metric value, child, and parent categories.
See the use case examples for more details.


#### Create a treemap query
To generate a treemap, write a query that returns events in the correct data format.

#### Query syntax
To generate a treemap visualization, use this query syntax.

```
... | stats <stats_function>(<metric_field>) [<stats_function>(<color_field>)] by <parent_category_field> <child_category_field>
```

#### Results table columns
| First | Second | Third | Fourth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parent category | Child category | Rectangle size | Rectangle color |

#### Query example
Here is part of a query tracking files and directories.
```
... | stats sum(size) as size by parent_directory, child_directory
```
